# tillio


A framework that allows you to drag and drop controls from a list of tiles onto a canvas.
First provide the 2 divs for the tiles list and the canvas.
Then implement tillio controls and provide tillio with a thumbnail and control for each.

Browserfiy is a pre-requisite for this project.
Look at the test section for examples.
